## Migration Notes

This project was migrated from Create React App (CRA) to Vite for improved performance and faster development experience.

### Key Changes:

- **Build Tool**: Switched from Webpack to Vite
- **Development Server**: Now runs on port 5173 instead of 3000
- **Build Output**: Files are now in `dist/` instead of `build/`
- **Hot Reload**: Faster refresh times with Vite's HMR
